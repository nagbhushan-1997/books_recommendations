# Book Recommendation System

This repository contains the implementation of a Book Recommendation System using various machine learning techniques and libraries.

## Major Libraries Used

- **Pandas**: For data manipulation and analysis.
- **NumPy**: For numerical computations.
- **Scikit-learn**: For machine learning algorithms.
- **Surprise**: For building and analyzing recommender systems.
- **Matplotlib**: For data visualization.
## Dataset

The dataset used for this project was downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/arashnic/book-recommendation-dataset). It contains book ratings and other relevant information necessary for building the recommendation system.


## Installation

To install the required packages, run the following command:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn surprise matplotlib seaborn
```

## Implementation

1. **Data Collection**: We collected the book ratings dataset from a reliable source.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaned and preprocessed the data using Pandas.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualized the data using Matplotlib and Seaborn to understand the distribution and relationships.
4. **Model Building**: 
    - Used Scikit-learn to implement various machine learning algorithms.
    - Utilized the Surprise library to build collaborative filtering models.
5. **Evaluation**: Evaluated the models using appropriate metrics to ensure accuracy and reliability.
6. **Recommendation**: Generated book recommendations based on user preferences and historical data.

## Usage

To use the book recommendation system, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
     ```bash
     git clone https://github.com/yourusername/book_recommendation_system.git
     ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
     ```bash
     cd book_recommendation_system
     ```
3. Run the main script to get book recommendations:
     ```bash
     python main.py
     ```
